This program is written for pricing in cellular cognitive radio
By Zahra Fattah

For creating a cellular network, CellNo BS is created and set in locations with an even-q vertical layout.
This code represents a cellular network with two types of customers.
Each cell contains different spectrums with different prices.
Each customer can request three different classes of services.
The available bandwidth for each consumer is calculated base on his distance from BS and the co-channel interference caused by other consumers.
A secondary consumer can use the free spectrums of primary consumers in each channel. By using the Simulated annealing method, the secondary user will choose the best spectrums to have the lowest price.
